# convert_roman_numerals_with_python

## Description
`convert_roman_numerals_with_python` is a Python-based utility designed to facilitate the conversion between Roman numerals and standard integer values. It provides functions to accurately translate Roman numerals like 'IX' to 9, and integers like 1994 to 'MCMXCIV'. This project is perfect for developers needing to integrate Roman numeral handling in their applications, students learning about number systems, or anyone curious about Roman numeral conversions.

## Features

*   Converts valid Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values.
*   Converts positive integers to their Roman numeral representation.
*   Handles common Roman numeral validation (e.g., recognizes invalid sequences).
*   Simple script-based execution for ease of use.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer, if any dependencies are added later)

### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/axellee1994/convert_roman_numerals_with_python.git
    cd convert_roman_numerals_with_python
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project currently does not require external libraries beyond standard Python. If dependencies are added in the future, they will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage Instructions

The core functionality is provided by the `convert.py` script.

**Running the Script:**
1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated.
3.  Execute the script. The specific command might vary depending on how `convert.py` is designed to be used (e.g., if it takes command-line arguments or runs interactively).

    **Example (assuming it takes command-line arguments or has a main function to demonstrate usage):**
    ```bash
    python3 convert.py
    ```
    Or, if it's designed to be imported and used in other Python scripts:
    ```python
    # In your Python script or interpreter:
    # from convert import to_roman, from_roman # Assuming these function names
    #
    # integer_value = from_roman("XIV")
    # print(f"XIV is {integer_value}") # Output: XIV is 14
    #
    # roman_value = to_roman(42)
    # print(f"42 is {roman_value}")   # Output: 42 is XLII
    ```

**Expected Output:**
*   The script will output the result of the conversion (either an integer or a Roman numeral string) to the console, or return values if used as a module.
*   Error messages will be displayed for invalid inputs.
